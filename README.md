Wavelength is an online game that let's user's challenge friend's in a game of creativity and connection. Players begin by entering a random word of their choice. If the choose the same word, the game ends and they achieve victory together. If they choose different words, players have the apportunity to decide if the word's were close enough and end the game if they both decide so. Otherwise, the game will continue to the next round. In every round following the first, player's are shown the two word's from the previous round and have 30 seconds to come up with a word that is related to both words. The goal of the game is for player's to use the two word's from the previous round to try and enter the same word. The game progresses until players succeed or decide to give up.

The project backend of the project is build on node with a PostgresSQL database. The frontend is built on React and Redux. Realtime communication for player's in a game is handled with Websockets.
